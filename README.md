Introduction to Machine Organization and assembly langiage
This course introduces students to the structure and behavior of modern digital computers and the way they execute programs. Machine organization topics include the Von Neumann model of execution, functional organization of computer hardware, the memory hierarchy, caching performance, and pipelining. Assembly language topics include representations of numbers in computers, basic instruction sets, addressing modes, stacks and procedures, low-level I/O, and the functions of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders. The course also presents how code and data structures of higher-level languages are mapped into the assembly language and machine representations of a modern processor. Programming projects will be carried out in the C language and the assembly language of a modern processor.

Note:
BombLab- bomb-642(Number 642):The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of “binary bombs” on the course server. A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin. If you type the correct string, then the phase is disarmed and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase has been disarmed.
There are too many bombs for us to deal with, so we are giving each student a separate bomb to de- fuse. Your mission — which you have no choice but to accept — is to defuse your bomb before the due date. Good luck, and welcome to the bomb squad!


DataLab - datalab: The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with bit-level representations of integers and floating point numbers. You’ll do this by solving a series of programming “puzzles.” Many of these puzzles are quite artificial, but you’ll find yourself thinking much more about bits in working your way through them.

AtaackLab - target4: This assignment involves generating a total of five attacks on two programs having different security vulnerabilities. Outcomes you will gain from this lab include:
 You will learn different ways that attackers can exploit security vulnerabilities when programs do not safeguard themselves well enough against buffer overflows.
 Through this, you will get a better understanding of how to write programs that are more se- cure, as well as some of the features provided by compilers and operating systems to make programs less vulnerable.
 You will gain a deeper understanding of the stack and parameter-passing mechanisms of x86- 64 machine code.
 You will gain a deeper understanding of how x86-64 instructions are encoded.
 You will gain more experience with debugging tools such as gdb and objdump.
